# Deep-Learning-Algorithms-based-Computer-aided-Diagnosis-for-Lung-Cancer
In this work, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect the cancerous nodules .Generally , benign nodules are less cancerous and cannot spread in other parts of body while malignant nodules are highly chance of being cancerous and can spread it to other parts of body. In our work , images of benign and malignant were used  for our CNN. Our CNN established, trained, and validated using data set. Model evaluation showed that the CNN model is able to detect the cancerous nodules with 68.84 % accuracy.
